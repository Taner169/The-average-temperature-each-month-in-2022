This repository contains a Python script that analyzes and visualizes the average temperature for each month in 2022 in Stockholm, Sweden. It uses linear regression to model the trend of temperatures throughout the year.

Features
Data Reading: Load monthly temperature data from a CSV file.
Data Analysis: Calculate mean values and apply simple linear regression to derive the temperature trend.
Visualization: Plot the original data points along with the regression line to visualize the trend.
How to Use
Ensure you have Python installed along with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
Place the temp2022.csv file in the same directory as the script, or modify the script to match the location of your file.
Run the script to generate the plot. This will display the scatter plot of average temperatures along with the regression line.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Sample Output
Running the script will create a plot titled "Meantemp Stockholm 2022" showing the average temperatures per month with a red line indicating the linear regression fit. This plot aids in visualizing the temperature changes and assessing the accuracy of the linear model.

This repository is an excellent resource for those looking to understand basic data analysis and visualization techniques in Python, particularly in the context of environmental data.
